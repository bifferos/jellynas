You need Zim to read this notebook.  It can be installed on most systems.

The homepage is [here](https://zim-wiki.org/downloads.html)

On Linux mint I just install via the software manager.  
On Mac I install it [via homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/zim)  
On Windows it's available [via chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/zim)
(I've never tried this).

You can just follow the instructions on the Zim homepage if you prefer.
